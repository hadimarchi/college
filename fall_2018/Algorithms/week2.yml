Summations:
  sum(i) from i=1 to i=n = n(n+1)/2 ~= n^2/2
  sum(i^2) from i=1 to i=n ~= n^3/3
  sum(i) from i=l to i=u = sum(i)1-u - sum(i)1-l
  sum(a^i) from 0 to n = 1 + a + a^2 ... + a^n = (a^n+1 -1)/(a-1)
    - sum(10^i) = (10^n+1 -1)/(10-1)
  sum(i*2i) from i=1 to i=n = (n-1)(2^n+1) + 2
  sum(1/i) from 0 to n does not converge
    - approximately ln(n) + y(oiler's constant, approx 0.5772)
Combinatorics:
  permutations of 1 - n = n!
  nCk = n!/((n-k)! * k!)
  number subsets of set N of size n = 2^n
  sum(nCk) from k=0 to k=n = 2^n
  sum(1) from i=l to i=u = u-l+1

Analysis:
  - Choose way of measuring input size
  - Choose basic operation
  - Does num of basic ops depend only on the size of input?
    - if it depends on property of input, need best/worst case
    - otherwise idea of input may need to be expande
  - Set up a summation
  - Evaluate summation
