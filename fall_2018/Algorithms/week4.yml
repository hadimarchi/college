Topological Sort:
  Of a Digraph:
    Ordering of vertices so that every arc of digrap points from earlier to later vertex.

  DAG:
    Directed acyclic graph: digraph with no directed cycle
    Fact: A digraph has a topological sort precisely if (if and only if) it is a DAG

  Sort Algorithm 1:
    Based on DFS
    How:
      - Do DFS and record order of visitations.
      - Reverse
      - Have a topological ordering
    Weakness:
      - Gets complicated when there is a cycle.

  Sort Algorithm 2:
    Find-Source:
      Source: vertex with no arc pointing toward it
    Decrease and Conquer:
      - digraph has no vertices then end (success)
      - try to find a source
        - if non, digraph is not a DAG; end(failure)
        - if there is a source s then output s, remove s from the digraph, do
          a topological source on what remains
