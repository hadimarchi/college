Unit Testing:
  testable: software designs that allow for convenient unit testing
    Code is:
      - testable (has known correct output)
      - modular
      - configurable/customizable

  3 A's of unit tests:
    1: Arrange
      - set up what you need
    2: Act
      - perform operation being tested
    3: Assert
      - Require/Assert that the output was correct

  Closure: Functions that carries some part of the environment it was defined
           in with it
           Purpose: Substitute for an object that exists so that a single member
                    function can be called
