    - When requirements change, any WIP may be abandoned

Don't Make Me Think:
  Key Messages:
    - A user should be able to 'get' the interface without thinking about it
    - Websites are not read fully, they are scanned
    - Users prefer many mindless clicks to few thought required clicks
      - Mindless choices = good!
    - Omit needless words
      - Especially 'happy talk'
        - Useless bulky welcoming introductory text
      - Eliminate instructions by making everything self explanatory


  Designing Navigation:
    Finding:
      - Ask First (search-dominant)
      - Browse First (link-dominant)
    Hierarchy:
      - Make visible
        - tells us what the site contains
        - tells us how to use it
        - gives user confidence
    Persistent Navigation:
      - Elements that appear on every page of site
        - Safety of consistency = less panicked thinking
    Trust:
      - Interface should inspire confidence and trust!

    Trunk Test:
      - choose any page in site and print it
      - hold at arms length
      - as quickly as possible identify:
        - site id
        - page name
        - Sections (primary navigation)
        - Local navigation
        - 'You are here' indicators
        - Search

    Theory of Web Design:
      What does/could a home page need?:
        - Site identity and mission(as in goal of page)
        - Site hierarchy
        - Search
        - Teases
        - Content promos
        - Feature promos
        - Timely content - helps users return more often
        - Deals
        - Shortcuts (10 mindless clicks ok unless you need to do it several times/day)
        - Registration (register, sign in, or you are signed in)
      Abstract homepage objectives:
        - Show me what I'm looking for
        - Show me what might be interesting
        - Show me where to start
        - Establish credibility and trust
    Usability:
      - Arguing about it is (usually) a waste of time
        Bad: Do people like pulldown menus?
        Good: Does this pulldown for this list on this page for this site
              for users that will likely use the site work well?
