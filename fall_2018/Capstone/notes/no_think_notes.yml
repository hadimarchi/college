Chapter 1:
  Krug's First Law of Usability:
  DON'T MAKE ME THINK!
  Webpage:
    - Everything should be self-evident (no thought)
      - Sometimes it can't be, must then be self-explanatory (little thought)
    - Users should not ask:
       - Where am I?
       - Where should I begin?
       - Where did they put _____?
       - What are the most important things on this page?
       - Why did they call it that?
       - Is that an ad or part of the site

Chapter 2: How we really use the web
  How:
    SCANNING, SATISFICING, AND MUDDLING THROUGH

    Facts of Life:
      1: We don't read pages, we scan them
        Why:
          - We're ususally on a mission
          - We know we don't have to read everything
          - We're good at it

      2: We don't make optimal choices. We satisfice.
          Elaboration: Users choose the first reasonable option(satisficing),
                       not the best one
          Why:
            - We're usually in a hurry
            - Not much of a cost for guessing wrong
            - Weighing options might not improve our chances
            - Guessing is more fun
      3: We don't figure out how things work, we muddle through
        Why:
          - How it works isn't important to us
          - If we find something that works we stick with it
        Get it: Better to make it easy for the user to get it

Chapter 3: Billboard Design 101
  How to maximize user comprehension:
    - Take advantage of conventions
      - Clarity trumps Consistency (but consistency is still good)
    - Create effective visual hierarchies
    - Break pages up into clearly defined areas
    - Make it obvious whatâ€™s clickable
    - Eliminate distractions
    - Format content to support scanning
