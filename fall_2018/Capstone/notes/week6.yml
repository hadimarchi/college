TNEL: TYPE NOW EDIT LATER
Kanban:
  Board:
    Columns:
      - Backlog
      - Specify
       - Active & Done columns
      - Implement
       - Active & Done columns
      - Validate
       - Active & Done columns
  Quickstart:
    1: Capture your team's high-level routine
    2: Re-decorate your wall (with Kanban board)
    3: Set limits on chaos
    4: Define done
    5: Run your daily standup

  Step 1: What do developers do?
    - Discuss product with partners, teammates and customers
    - Write and answer email, texts, etc
    - Find, evaluate, and fix bugs and operational issues (tickets)
    - Track feedback
    - Produce improvements to products and infrastructure
    - Prepare for a major presentation
    - Major design documents
    - Rolling out major changes
    - and more!

    Guidelines:
      - Include only the steps your team does
      - Combine sequential steps that are usually done by the same person
      - When in doubt, start with
        - Backlog
        - Specify
        - Implement
        - Validate
  Step 2: Re-decorate your wall
    - Post the steps on a signboard close to where your team works
    - Computer vs. Physical

  Step 3: I zoned out

  Step 4: Define done
    - Develop a done criteria/set of rules
      Examples:
        Specify: all items broken into tasks that can be finished in less than
                 a wekk and quick specs completed for each item
        Implement: code is reviewed and unit tested, static analysis is clean, code
                   is checked in, acceptance tests pass and customer-facing documentation
                   is complete
        Validate: work is deployed to production and tried by a significant subset
                  of real customers. All issues found are resolved.

  Step 5: Run daily standup
    - With a loaded backlog no planning meeting is necessary
    - Kanban flows continuously as long as there is work to do
    - Daily standup meetings at the Kanban board are the only regular meetings
    Daily standup:
      - Team project manager ususally runs the standup
      - Ask whether any team members are block or need assistance
      - Assign people to resolve issues
      - Experienced teams can complete the standup in 5 minutes
      - Can extend and have each team member say what they are doing and potential
        problems they are concerned with
      - Focus is keeping them short and everybody in attendance
