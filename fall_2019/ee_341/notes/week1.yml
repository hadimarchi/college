Title: Intro to Circuit Theory
Notes:
  Goal: Determine mathematical model that will
    - Calculate voltage at any point in the circuit relative to any other point
    - Calculate current in any circuit branch
  Assumptions:
    - All circuit effects occur instantly in all components
    - The wavelength of the applied signals is larger than the hardware

  Laws:
    Ohm's Law: V = IR
    KCL: Current at any one point is zero (I think)
    KVL: Sum of voltage around loop must be zero
    Superposition: If a system has more than one source we can break the sytem up into the effects of each individual source and sum them

  Technology:
    Topology: systematic application of KCL and KVL in order to solve complex circuits
              Mesh Analysis
              Nodal Analysis
    Thevenin's Theorem: Simplify to terminal outputs (I think)
    Source Transform: Voltage source to current source

  Digital Logic:
    Combinational: Output is a function of current inputs
    Sequential: Output is a function of the inputs and current output
  Chips:
    Standard: Standard configuration that represents a fix function. Wasteful of space but cheap.
    Programmable: Reconfigurable (by code written by user). Not optimized for speed/power/area compared to custom
    Custom/AISC: Fixed but complex, efficient functionality. Fixed functionality is user specified pre-production. Higher cost.

  Moore's Law: Number of transitors on a chip doubles every 1.5 to 2 years. Still true but slowing.

  Technology Node Size: measured in nm, length/width of channel(n-channel) between source and drain regions in a transistor.
    Drain Region Voltage: Vgs
    Output (Around the n-gate): Vo
    Transistor-Inverter: input in, !input out

    Smaller: Higher integration density, higher speed, potentially lower power
